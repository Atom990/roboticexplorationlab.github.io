title: Fast Trajectory Optimization

description: |
  Building new solvers for trajectory optimization problems that are fast, accurate, and numerically robust. Recent work has bridged the gap between indirect and direct solvers, with an implemention of iLQR capable of: handling nonlinear equality and inequality constraints, warm starts, and quadrature and first-order control schemes comparable to classic direct collocation.
