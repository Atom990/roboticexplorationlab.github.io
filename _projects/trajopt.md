title: Fast Trajectory Optimization

description: |
  Building new solvers for trajectory optimization problems that are fast, accurate, and numerically robust. Currently developing a novel indirect solver, based off of iterative LQR (iLQR), that allows for general inequality and equality constraints, specification of an initial state trajectory, and Hermite-Simpson integration. The open-source code, written in Julia, is available for download at "https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/TrajectoryOptimization.jl.git".
