title: Trajectory Optimization in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP)

description: |
  The CR3BP is a useful model for designing and analyzing spacecraft trajectories that pass between multiple large bodies. We use optimization techniques to find trajectories that meet mission constraints while being dynamically feasible in the CR3BP.

NASA has great interest in developing deep space missions to several of the moonsof Jupiter and Saturn.  Jupiterâ€™s moon Europa, where evidence points to the exis-tence of a vast subsurface ocean, is especially intriguing. The Europa Lander studyaims to determine the feasibility of a robotic mission to this ocean world with theexpress goal to search for signs of life.  Such missions to deep space have tightconstraints on mass, and any savings in fuel can be used for scientific instrumenta-tion. Mission designers are focusing on low-thrust trajectories to reach the surfaceof  Europa  in  a  fuel-efficient  manner. The attached video shows on such potential trajectory passing through the L2 gateway into Europa's sphere of influence.
