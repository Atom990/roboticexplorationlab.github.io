We examine a particular class of inflated-beam soft growing robots called "vine robots", and present a dynamics simulator that captures general behaviors, handles robot-object interactions, and runs faster than real time. The simulator framework uses a simplified multi-link, rigid-body model with contact constraints. 

We are currently working on expanding the dynamics model and integrating the simulator framework with motion planning strategies.
