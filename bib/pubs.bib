  title = {Contact-{{Implicit Optimization}} of {{Locomotion Trajectories}} for a {{Quadrupedal Microrobot}}},
  abstract = {Planning locomotion trajectories for legged microrobots is challenging because of their complex morphology, high frequency passive dynamics, and discontinuous contact interactions with their environment. Consequently, such research is often driven by time-consuming experimental methods. As an alternative, we present a framework for systematically modeling, planning, and controlling legged microrobots. We develop a threedimensional dynamic model of a 1.5 g quadrupedal microrobot with complexity (e.g., number of degrees of freedom) similar to larger-scale legged robots. We then adapt a recently developed variational contact-implicit trajectory optimization method to generate feasible whole-body locomotion plans for this microrobot, and we demonstrate that these plans can be tracked with simple joint-space controllers. We plan and execute periodic gaits at multiple stride frequencies and on various surfaces. These gaits achieve high per-cycle velocities, including a maximum of 10.87 mm/cycle, which is 15\% faster than previously measured velocities for this microrobot. Furthermore, we plan and execute a vertical jump of 9.96 mm, which is 78\% of the microrobot's center-of-mass height. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end demonstration of planning and tracking whole-body dynamic locomotion on a millimeter-scale legged microrobot.},

  title = {Variational {{Contact}}-{{Implicit Trajectory Optimization}}},
  abstract = {Contact constraints arise naturally in many robot planning problems. In recent years, a variety of contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithms have been developed that avoid the pitfalls of mode pre-specification by simultaneously optimizing state, input, and contact force trajectories. However, their reliance on first-order integrators leads to a linear tradeoff between optimization problem size and plan accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a new family of trajectory optimization algorithms that leverage ideas from discrete variational mechanics to derive higher-order generalizations of the classic time-stepping method of Stewart and Trinkle. By using this dynamics formulation as constraints in a direct trajectory optimization scheme, it is possible to perform contact-implicit trajectory optimization with significantly improved accuracy compared to existing methods. For concreteness, we derive a second-order method and evaluate it using several simulated rigid body systems.},

  abstract = {Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool with many important applications in robotic motion planning and control. However, most existing algorithm implementations fall into one of two categories: either they rely on general-purpose off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers that are numerically robust and capable of handling arbitrary constraints but tend to be slow, or they use custom numerical methods that are fast but lack robustness and have limited or no ability to deal with constraints. This paper presents ALTRO (Augmented Lagrangian TRajectory Optimizer), a novel algorithm for solving constrained trajectory optimization problems that bridges this gap by offering fast convergence, numerical robustness, and the ability to handle general nonlinear state and input constraints. We demonstrate ALTRO's capabilities on a set of benchmark motion-planning problems and offer comparisons to the standard direct collocation (DIRCOL) method.},

Current approaches to white-box modeling using analytic parameterizations, or black-box modeling using neural networks, can suffer from high bias or high variance. We address the need for a flexible, gray-box model of mechanical systems that can seamlessly incorporate prior knowledge where it is available, and train expressive function approximators where it is not. We propose to parameterize a mechanical system using neural networks to model its Lagrangian and the generalized forces that act on it. We test our method on a simulated, actuated double pendulum. We show that our method outperforms a naive, black-box model in terms of data-efficiency, as well as performance in model-based reinforcement learning. We also conduct a systematic study of our method's ability to incorporate available prior knowledge about the system to improve data efficiency.},

In this work, we leverage recent advances in bilevel optimization to design an algorithm capable of efficiently generating trajectories that involve making and breaking contact. We demonstrate our method's efficiency by outperforming an alternative state-of-the-art method on a benchmark problem.

PyCubed addresses many hardwarerelated failure modes through component and system-level radiation testing, in-depth design and qualification documentation, and flight heritage on a successful LEO mission. The challenge of flight software development is also mitigated through the use of the Python programming language via CircuitPython. Python enables dramatically simplified CubeSat software development, allowing students and researchers to quickly and reliably integrate new sensors, control algorithms, and payload hardware into their missions.
