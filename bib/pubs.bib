  abstract = {The hardware and software pitfalls associated with satellite development have led to a nearly 60\% failure rate among first-time CubeSat builders. We believe that a high-quality, community-driven CubeSat avionics platform would dramatically improve mission success rates. PyCubed is an open-source, radiation-tested CubeSat avionics platform that integrates power, computing, communication, and attitude determination and control functionality into a single low-cost PC104-compatible module programmable entirely in Python. PyCubed addresses many hardwarerelated failure modes through component and system-level radiation testing, in-depth design and qualification documentation, and flight heritage on a successful LEO mission. The challenge of flight software development is also mitigated through the use of the Python programming language via CircuitPython. Python enables dramatically simplified CubeSat software development, allowing students and researchers to quickly and reliably integrate new sensors, control algorithms, and payload hardware into their missions. All design files, including additional design justifications and reliability documentation, are available on the project's GitHub site.},

  abstract = {Contact constraints arise naturally in many robot planning problems. In recent years, a variety of contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithms have been developed that avoid the pitfalls of mode pre-specification by simultaneously optimizing state, input, and contact force trajectories. However, their reliance on first-order integrators leads to a linear tradeoff between optimization problem size and plan accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a new family of trajectory optimization algorithms that leverage ideas from discrete variational mechanics to derive higher-order generalizations of the classic time-stepping method of Stewart and Trinkle. By using these dynamics formulations as constraints in direct trajectory optimization algorithms, it is possible to perform contact-implicit trajectory optimization with significantly higher accuracy. For concreteness, we derive a second-order method and evaluate it using several simulated rigidbody systems, including an underactuated biped and a quadruped. In addition, we use this second-order method to plan locomotion trajectories for a complex quadrupedal microrobot. The planned trajectories are evaluated on the physical platform and result in a number of performance improvements.},

  abstract = {Planning locomotion trajectories for legged microrobots is challenging because of their complex morphology, high frequency passive dynamics, and discontinuous contact interactions with their environment. Consequently, such research is often driven by time-consuming experimental methods. As an alternative, we present a framework for systematically modeling, planning, and controlling legged microrobots. We develop a threedimensional dynamic model of a 1.5 g quadrupedal microrobot with complexity (e.g., number of degrees of freedom) similar to larger-scale legged robots. We then adapt a recently developed variational contact-implicit trajectory optimization method to generate feasible whole-body locomotion plans for this microrobot, and we demonstrate that these plans can be tracked with simple joint-space controllers. We plan and execute periodic gaits at multiple stride frequencies and on various surfaces. These gaits achieve high per-cycle velocities, including a maximum of 10.87 mm/cycle, which is 15\% faster than previously measured velocities for this microrobot. Furthermore, we plan and execute a vertical jump of 9.96 mm, which is 78\% of the microrobot's center-of-mass height. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end demonstration of planning and tracking whole-body dynamic locomotion on a millimeter-scale legged microrobot.},

However, most existing algorithm implementations fall into one of two categories: either they rely on general-purpose off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers that are numerically robust and capable of handling arbitrary constraints but tend to be slow, or they use custom numerical methods that are fast but lack robustness and have limited or no ability to deal with constraints. This paper presents ALTRO (Augmented Lagrangian TRajectory Optimizer), a novel algorithm for solving constrained trajectory optimization problems that bridges this gap by offering fast convergence, numerical robustness, and the ability to handle general nonlinear state and input constraints. We demonstrate ALTRO's capabilities on a set of benchmark motion-planning problems and offer comparisons to the standard direct collocation (DIRCOL) method.},

Current approaches to white-box modeling using analytic parameterizations, or black-box modeling using neural networks, can suffer from high bias or high variance. We address the need for a flexible, gray-box model of mechanical systems that can seamlessly incorporate prior knowledge where it is available, and train expressive function approximators where it is not. We propose to parameterize a mechanical system using neural networks to model its Lagrangian and the generalized forces that act on it. We test our method on a simulated, actuated double pendulum. We show that our method outperforms a naive, black-box model in terms of data-efficiency, as well as performance in model-based reinforcement learning. We also conduct a systematic study of our method's ability to incorporate available prior knowledge about the system to improve data efficiency.},

a nominal torque profile that respects the spacecraft's actuator limitations. This
nominal maneuver is then tracked using a time-varying linear-quadratic regulator
(LQR). To demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control
technique, closed-loop Monte-Carlo simulations are performed from a variety of orbits and initial conditions. Our method is shown to significantly outperform
previous magnetorquer-only control schemes by offering convergence from large initial errors and fast slew rates that exploit the full performance capabilities of the actuators. Computational complexity of the method and future implementation in flight software onboard a CubeSat are also discussed.},

Current algorithms for solving these problems either rely on Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) methods, dynamic programming (DP), differential dynamic programming (DDP), or an iterative best response approach (IBR). The first two approaches have strong theoretical guarantees; however they becomes intractable in high-dimensional real-world applications. The third approach is grounded in the success of iLQR. It is scalable, but it cannot handle constraints. Finally, the iterative best response algorithm is a heuristic approach with unknown convergence properties, and it can suffer from stability and tractability issues. This paper introduces ALGAMES (Augmented Lagrangian GAME-theoretic Solver), a solver that handles trajectory optimization problems with multiple actors and general nonlinear state and input constraints. We evaluate our solver in the context of autonomous driving on scenarios involving numerous vehicles such as ramp merging, overtaking, and lane changing. We present simulation and timing results demonstrating the speed and the ability of the solver to produce efficient, safe, and natural autonomous behaviors.},
