			Contact constraints arise naturally in many robot planning problems. In recent years, a variety of contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithms have been developed that avoid the pitfalls of mode pre-specification by simultaneously optimizing state, input, and contact force trajectories. However, their reliance on first-order integrators leads to a linear tradeoff between optimization problem size and plan accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a new family of trajectory optimization algorithms that leverage ideas from discrete variational mechanics to derive higher-order generalizations of the classic time-stepping method of Stewart and Trinkle. By using this dynamics formulation as constraints in a direct trajectory optimization scheme, it is possible to perform contact-implicit trajectory optimization with significantly improved accuracy compared to existing methods. For concreteness, we derive a second-order method and evaluate it using several simulated rigid body systems.
