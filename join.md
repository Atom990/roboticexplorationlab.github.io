## Postdocs

We invite applications for a postdoctoral position in motion planning and control. Ideal candidates will have a strong research track record in robotics, aerospace engineering, optimization, and/or control and be motivated to lead a research effort that involves developing new algorithms and evaluating them both in simulation and on physical hardware.

A PhD in Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field is required. Candidates will be expected to carry out a creative and independent research agenda, publish scholarly papers, and take on a mentorship role for undergraduate and graduate students at Stanford. 

Applications should contain a CV, a cover letter describing research interests and goals, a complete list of publications, copies of up to three relevant scientific papers, and the names and contact information of three references (expected to provide letters of recommendation). Applications should be compiled into a single PDF and emailed to Zac Manchester (zacmanchester at stanford.edu) with the subject line "Postdoc Application".

## Stanford Students

If you have been admitted to Stanford and are interested in joining our lab, send Zac an email with your CV/resume and a short description of your background and interests.
