## Stanford Graduate Students

If you have been admitted to Stanford and are interested in joining our lab, send Zac an email with your CV/resume and a short description of your background and interests. 

## Stanford Undergraduate Students

We often have opportunities for Stanford undergraduates to get involved in our research. If you're interested in robots, spacecraft, and control systems, send Zac an email.

## Visiting Student Researchers

I do not currently have funding to support non-Stanford students. If you have a fellowship and bring your own funding, please be aware of [Stanford's fees for visiting student researchers (VSOs)](https://registrar.stanford.edu/staff/visiting-student-researchers/fees-visiting-student-researchers).

## High School Interns

We are only able to work with high school students through [Stanford's RISE program](https://oso.stanford.edu/programs/39-rise-summer-internship-program).
