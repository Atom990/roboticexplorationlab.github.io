I"™<p>Weâ€™ve teamed up with talented students from the Stanford Robotics Club to develop control algorithms for new quadrupeds entirely designed by students of the Club. This project focuses on implementing state-of-the-art control strategies and getting them to run reliably on custom hardware. This project is looking for talented and motivated students to contribute, especially undergraduate students.</p>
