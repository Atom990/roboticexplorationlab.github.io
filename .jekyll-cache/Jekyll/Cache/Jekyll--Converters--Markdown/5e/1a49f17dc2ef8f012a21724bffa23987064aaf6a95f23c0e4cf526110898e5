I"S<p>We got to drive racecars! A big thanks to the Dynamic Design Lab here at Stanford for inviting us to join them up at Thunderhill racetrack. It was a blast and nobody got hurt (although someone earned the nickname “puker”). We look forward to futher collaboration with the DDL to put trajectory optimization on awesome hardware.</p>
