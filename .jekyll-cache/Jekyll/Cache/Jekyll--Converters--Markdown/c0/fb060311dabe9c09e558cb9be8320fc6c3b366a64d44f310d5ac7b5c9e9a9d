I"¶<p>Brian Jackson, a PhD Candidate in our lab, presented TrajectoryOptiization.jl, a package for state-of-the-art trajectory optimization solvers, at JuliaCon 2019 in Baltimore, USA. The 10-minute lightning talk presented the new package along with some the exciting preliminary results weâ€™ve already acheived, including novel, inexpensive methods for controlling CubeSats, solving problems with non-smooth costs, and coordinating multi-agent robotic systems with parallelizable algorithms for trajectory optimization. Weâ€™re very excited about the announcement of composable parallelism in Julia during the conference and look forward to applying it to make our solvers run even faster!</p>
